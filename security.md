We actively monitor our systems and applications for potential vulnerabilities and take immediate action to address issues. All user data is stored securely using trusted services such as Firebase, MongoDB, and Railway, and we never sell or misuse private data.

- Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond within 48 hours and will keep you informed of our progress.
