# ðŸŒ¿ PotBot: World's First AI-Powered Cannabis Scanner

PotBot is the **worldâ€™s first AI-powered cannabis scanner app**. 
It helps users and growers analyze cannabis buds and plants using real AI models â€” not mock data. 

The app scans images to provide:
- **Dank Score**: AI rating of bud quality (trichome density, trim, appearance, mold check). 
- **Grower Mode**: Detect growth stage, watering needs, nutrient balance, and harvest readiness. 
- **Leaderboard**: Rank your dank against the community. 
- **Personal Recommendations**: Get feedback and tips based on your scans.
